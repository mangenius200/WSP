	<p>  Instead of showing his projects he showed the symbol of the company for the specific project that he did it for.She also used image tags of the companies she did the projects for.
	When you click the text it tells you about it. She probably you a hoover function in her css where she when the user click on the image it d
	displays whats in the image tag.</p>
